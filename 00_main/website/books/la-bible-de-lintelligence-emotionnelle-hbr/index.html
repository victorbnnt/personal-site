									<h2>Partie 1: La pleine conscience</h2>
									<ul>
										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Les effets bénéfiques de la pleine conscience</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Définition: c'est l'attention sur l'instant présent, sans porter de jugement.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Permet augmentation significative de la matière grise.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- La pleine conscience ne devrait plus être considérée comme <i>nice to have</i> pour les dirigeants. C'est un <i>must have</i>.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Comment pratiquer la pleine conscience durant votre journée de travail</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Les individus passent près de 47% de leurs heures de veille à penser à autre chose qu'à ce qu'ils font.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Entrainez votre cerveau à mieux se concentrer en intégrant des exercices de pleine conscience dans votre journée.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Nous libérons la pluspart des hormones de stress dans les minutes qui suivent le réveil.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Lorsque vous vous réveillez, restez deux minutes dans votre lit en écoutant simplement votre respiration.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Lorsque vous arrivez à votre travail, prenez dix minutes avant de vous plonger dans votre activité.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Deux aptitudes définissent un esprit conscient: la focalisation et la lucidité.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Exécuter rapidement de petites tâches libère de la dopamine, une hormone agréable, dans votre cerveau. Ce phénomène nous rend dépendants des e-mails.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Pour ne pas rentrer dans une réunion avec l'esprit ailleurs, prenez deux minutes en cours de route pour pratiquer la pleine conscience.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Après le déjeuner, programmez la minuterie de votre téléphone pour qu'il sonne à chaque heure. cessez toute activité et pratiquez pendant une minute la pleine conscience.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Lorsque la journée s'achève, pendant au moins dix minutes durant le trajet, éteignez votre téléphone, fermez la radio et concentrez-vous sur vous-même.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">La pleine conscience pour les plus pressés</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- La pleine conscience désigne le fait d'être présent et lucide, instant après instant, indépendamment des circonstances.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Essayez une technique que j'appelle la <i>microméditation</i>. Ce sont des méditations qui peuvent être effectuées plusieurs fois par jour, durant une à trois minutes chacune. Régulièrement, tout au long de la journée.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- Mettez-vous à respirer de manière à faire descendre le souffle dans l'abdomen. Ne forcez pas les choses. Si cela ne vous semble pas naturel, essayez d'amener le souffle dans le bas de la poitrine. Si votre esprit vagabonde, revenez en douceur à la respiration.</div>
										<div style="text-align:justify">- La prochaine fois que vous participerez à une réunion, essayez de ne rien faire d'autre que d'écouter par tranches de quelques secondes.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Ne laissez pas le pouvoir vous corrompre</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">Cafe - December 1973 afternoon. Scene with a bar server and her mother. She is making her mother furious, for some reasons. She is then brought to the Auriac family castle by her furious mother. Next, she follows the entire Auriac family to an orgie near Ghent. She assists an orgie there, in particular, she sees her friend Florence (Auriac daugther) chain fucked by many men waiting in queue for their turn, one of them being her own father. She is now untouchable because it looks like Patrick is in love with her and wants her for himself.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 4</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">Scene with Patrick. She explains him she has already seen many dead corpses. She is in the castle and many chil are arriving, they are directed to Florence which has the role of small chief there. Some of the arriving children are selected, some others are killed (young morroco kid shot for example).</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 5</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">Saturday night - March 1974. She is brought to an orgie by her mother. Apparently, she is raped multiple times. The next day, her mother doesn't come take her. She waits 5 days there, alone, without eating. When her mother finally comes to get her, she is in an horific state. She is accused to volontarily stay away from home. Her father who is often travelling for his work, is in Belgium at home at this particular moment. When she comes back to home, her father jockingly tells her that she prefers to stay in the higher ring than see her father. At the end, she is in a horific state and has lost several kilos because she didn't eat these 5 days. She has knots in her hairs, her mother cuts her hairs to punish her to be such a bad girl. Parents are crazy.</div>

										<div style="text-align:justify">We learn that Florence - the girl who was chain fucked by many mens and having pleasure in doing that - is 11 years old. Ann is with Florence and there are some friends of her. Ann is raped in the mud by these guys. It looks like she is enjoying it... The last to rape her is Peter, she wants to see him again later. We will learn later that Florence organized this rape because she doesn't like Ann.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 7</li>
										<div style="text-align:justify">Her mother brings her to a mansion where she meets Patrick again. They fuck savagely and she enjoys it. From now she has two "lovers": Peter and Patrick. Sunday morning, they go to the backery but everyone is looking at them. Very strange for a 21 year old guy to be with a 11 years old girl isn't it ? They then drive fast to a restaurant and ask for a breakfast before lunch. Very weird. When the chef goes to the kitchen, they go to the toilet - Patrick wants to fuck her. Finally they don't - indeed they may have problems if the chef would catch them doing that... -, Ann escapes using toilet window and Patrick goes take the Porsche and they leave.</div>

										<li style="font-size:x-large; color:black;font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 8</li>

										<div style="text-align:justify">She wakes up the next day and they are in France near Aix en provence. It's June 1974. They reach Patrick family house in Saint Jean cap Ferrat. They spend many days there enjoying the place. They have long discussion admitting their mutual love.</div>
